# Fake News Detection Model
**Overview**
This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting fake news using a Logistic Regression algorithm. The model analyzes news articles and classifies them as either "real" or "fake" based on their content.

## Features
- Classifies news articles as "real" or "fake."
- Utilizes a Logistic Regression algorithm for prediction.
- Easy-to-use interface for inputting new articles for classification.
- Includes data preprocessing and model evaluation metrics.

##Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development)

## Dataset
- The dataset used for training the model consists of labeled news articles, with features extracted from the text. You can download the dataset from
